# flappy-bird
This project is a simple Flappy Bird clone built using Java AWT and Swing. The game features a player-controlled bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by flapping its wings to stay airborne. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with obstacles or falling off the screen.
